;;; Commentary:

;; This is oauth client library implementation in elisp. It is
;; capable of authenticating (receiving an access token) and signing
;; requests. Currently it only supports HMAC-SHA1, although adding
;; additional signature methods should be relatively straight forward.

;; Visit http://oauth.net/core/1.0a for the complete oauth spec.

;; Oauth requires the client application to receive user authorization in order
;; to access restricted content on behalf of the user. This allows for
;; authenticated communication without jeopardizing the user's password.
;; In order for an application to use oauth it needs a key and secret
;; issued by the service provider.

;; Usage:

;; Obtain access token:

;; The easiest way to obtain an access token is to call (oauth-authorize-app)
;; This will authorize the application and return an oauth-access-token.
;; You will use this token for all subsequent requests. In many cases
;; it will make sense to serialize this token and reuse it for future sessions.
;; At this time, that functionality is left to the application developers to
;; implement (see yammer.el for an example of token serialization).

;; Two helper functions are provided to handle authenticated requests:
;; (oauth-fetch-url) and (oauth-post-url)
;; Both take the access-token and a url.
;; Post takes an additional parameter post-vars-alist which is a
;; list of key val pairs to be used in a x-www-form-urlencoded message.

;; yammer.el:
;; http://github.com/psanford/emacs-yammer/tree/master is an example
;; mode that uses oauth.el

;; Dependencies:

;; The default behavior of oauth.el is to dispatch to curl for http
;; communication. It is strongly recommended that you use curl.
;; If curl is unavailable you can set oauth-use-curl to nil and oauth.el
;; will try to use the emacs internal http functions (url-request).
;; Note: if you plan on doing https and have oauth-use-curl set to nil,
;; make sure you have gnutls-bin installed.

;; oauth.el uses hmac-sha1 library for generating signatures. An implementation
;; by Derek Upham is included for convenience.

;; This library assumes that you are using the oauth_verifier method
;; described in the 1.0a spec.

  ;; Sad hack: There are two different implementations of hmac-sha1
  ;; One by Derek Upham (included with oauth),
  ;; and one by Shuhei KOBAYASHI (in the FLIM package).
  ;; Both functions work but they have different parameter orderings.
  ;; To deal with this we have this nice test to figure out which one
  ;; is actually available to us. Hopefully things will *just work*.
